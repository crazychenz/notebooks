## Dealing with demotivation.

Some take aways from Blow's [Techniques for dealing with lack of motivation, malaise, depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo)

**Negative Thoughts** - You can shrink negative thoughts by turning down your internal filter on your personal observations.

**Physical Effects Of Emotions** - Focus on aspects of body's contact with outside world (e.g. butt in chair.) This registration of sensation will ground the mind.

**Psychological Effects Of Emotions** - Focus on aspects of the emotion, without trying to change the feeling. Ideally, the focus on the emotion will minimize its impact by draining its fuel.

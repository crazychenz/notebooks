## Catch Test Framework

Catch is a single-header file test framework. It doesn't provide the mocking capabilities, but I really have no need for mocks at this time. (Mocks are usually everything wrong with unit testing anyway.)

My favorite feature of catch is its ability to provide a BDD workflow. Here is my example test:

```c++
#include "catch.hpp"

#include <memory>

#include <Grid.hpp>
#include <Actor.hpp>
#include <Vector2.hpp>

using namespace std;

SCENARIO( "setting/getting grid positions") {

    shared_ptr<Grid> grid;

    GIVEN( "An uninitialized grid") {
        CHECK(grid == nullptr);
    }

    GIVEN( "An initialized grid" ) {
        grid = make_shared<Grid>();

        REQUIRE( grid != nullptr );

        WHEN( "actor set to position" ) {
            grid->set_position(Vector2(1, 0), make_shared<Actor>('X'));

            THEN( "the retrieved position should be not null and equal" ) {
                auto actor = grid->get_position(Vector2(1, 0));

                REQUIRE(actor != nullptr);
                REQUIRE(actor->ascii == 'X');
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Potential to speed up Catch2.

I actually tried this example with a single file and single test case. The precompiled header actually took 1 second longer than the uncompiled header. This is likely due to the lack or repetition currently in the test build. Keeping this github issue around for when I feel things could be optimized.



## C++ Documentation

Looks like C++ documentation is still the pits. Doxygen is still the dominate name in the game and anything better looks to require npm (which I am not willing to deal with at the moment.) Therefore, going forward I am just going to sprinkle markdown files throughout the code base adhoc.

Ideally, inline code documentation will follow the google coding style guide, but I'm likely to punt that until some future "production" phase of my code. [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

## C++ In Visual Studio

Some general purpose hot keys that make C++ a tiny bit more bearable:

* Move code - Alt-Up/Down
* Comment code selection - Ctrl-K+C/U

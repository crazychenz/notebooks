## Double Right Click

Was watching a 5 hour video today and wanted to work on some other stuff while it was playing. In the past I've always just resized my browser so it could sit in the corner of the screen. The trouble with this is that youtube adds all kind of margin noise that you can't get rid of without making the video canvas to small. Well, I decided that if my phone can handle doing picture in picture without a browser in the foreground, perhaps my desktop should be able to accomplish this. After looking up picture in picture for windows 10 on google, about 30 seconds later I had learned the solution. When you load and start a youtube video, if you double right click the video canvas, it brings up what appears to be a browser context menu (in contrast to the HTML5 context menu). Low and behold, there is a "Picture in picture" option that pops the video canvas into its own window that can be dragged around, resized, and stays on top.

Woot!

## (PottyTime is) Sokoban

Just realized that Potty Time is based on an old game called [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) from 1982. In summary, Sokoban has some interesting attributes for problem solving and AI. This is great because now I should be able to study Sokoban material to see if there are more clever ways to layout the levels. In addition to that, I've also discovered that Jonathan Blow (creator of Braid and Witness) is also creating a Sokoban type of game. He has a [long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tMb7OS2TOU&list=WL&index=10&t=406s) on managing the game states on YouTube that I viewed today. (Got to 3:10:00 of 4:49:00 before I quit.)

The outcome of this video is that in turn based games, especially ones with asynchronous actions, using a transactional system with conflict detection and resolution is a great design pattern. Some follow up has lead me to the StackOverflow question: [What Design Pattern to use to implement transaction or chaining mechanism?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33593767/what-design-pattern-to-use-to-implement-transaction-or-chaining-mechanism) The question isn't really what gave me the ah-ha moment, but some of the answers really triggered the concept. I've been aware of transactions from a database point of view for years, but I never made the connection that a discrete game state should be treated the same. 

What I am thinking about doing is developing my Action based system a bit more and then bundling the Actions into Transactions to see where that puts me. Each transaction is tracked as committed or uncommitted and assigned the time of the transactional request for priority sorting. There is still a weird place where we need to recursively sanity check that all the Actions within a transaction are legal, but we refrain from updating the state until the transaction is committed. Also, adding and logging the transactions gives us a natural undo mechanism.

Some other misc. takeaways from the video was that I really liked how their engine was able to interpolate at different speeds. So instead of halting all execution, the game was still legit, but slowed the tweens down globally. (I am assuming that the animations blocked further transactions until a certain threshold.) I also really like the console interface. I've always wanted a console interface in all of my games, but seeing it used in something not released has really inspired me. I think that my design patterns fit a console interaction better now anyway.

## Got My Laptop Back

Sent my laptop out around 2020/03/14 and just got it back on 2020/04/18. Given I know it probably took longer through a combination of HP's picky RMA process and the plague. Either way, like every other heartless IT shop, they wiped my drive. This gives me an opportunity to start documenting all the tools I install when I have a fresh Windows install.

Specific to the Spectre x360, I've installed high precision touchpad drivers to replace the stock touchpad drivers. The primary reason for this is that I prefer two finger swipe down to scroll down. This is in contrast to the "natural scroll" feel that is associated with touch screens. The stock driver doesn't provide this option. You can find some instructions for the setup [here](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/20/16175682/enable-precision-drivers-on-synaptics-touchpads). You can find a link to the driver zip file [here](https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n1mgx14w.zip).

On a more generic front:

* Windows Insider Updates - At the moment, this gets me WSL2.
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - Because it is the best desktop browser. (I actually prefer Edge for parental control.)
* A default projects directory structure: C:\projects\\\[stable|playground|school\]
* [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q) (on WSL2) - Before installing this, I make sure I've enabled the required virtualization features in Windows 10 and set the WSL default setting to version 2: 
  `wsl --set-default-version 2`
* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - Instead of installing git from Ubuntu like I would prefer, I install (Portable) Git for Windows and then alias git to that exe binary. This prevents an issue where posix git doesn't play well with NTFS limitations. (I don't think this is an issue with exFAT.)
* [Typora](https://typora.io/) - My absolute favorite word processor. It is minimalistic and all styling is performed by typing markdown. Since I've found this tool, I've written all my graduate papers with it and all of the documents in crazychenz/notebooks are written in markdown with Typora.
* [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701) - The new and improved terminal application for Windows. ConEmu feels so clunky compared to the new Windows Terminal.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads) - The quickest most full feature raw text editor for Windows.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The most fluid and feature rich IDE today.
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Free virtualization hypervisor. (The new 6.x.y series supposedly uses Hyper-V if available.) This may not be needed if Hyper-V is available, but I've used this for older windows loads and odd ball Linux setups in the past.
* [Docker Desktop (Edge)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/edge-release-notes/) - Manage docker containers from Windows using the WSL2/Hyper-V backend
* [Draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) - Great lightweight diagraming tool. Works way better than its heavyweight alternatives.
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - The only non-SMS chat client that I use regularly. Slack is ok when required, but I love discord.
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - Best open source game engine.
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) - I pay for this, so I should install and use it. ;-P

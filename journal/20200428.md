## Keeping Windows On Top

https://www.howtogeek.com/196958/the-3-best-ways-to-make-a-window-always-on-top-on-windows/

https://www.autohotkey.com/

Created a file with path:
`%appdata%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\AlwaysOnTop.ahk`

Put the follow contents in the file:

```
#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

^T:: Winset, Alwaysontop, , A
```

Now when you hit Ctrl+T, it'll keep the current window on top. Hit Ctrl+T on the held window to return it to normal behavior.

* Pool Allocator - Good as an object allocator when many of the same object is used.
* Linear/Stack Allocator - Ok as a coupled list of different object types. (Transaction of commands.) In reality, its preferred to provide a common base class for all elements of the collection, then hold a pointer to the object in a vector and have pool allocations for the objects themselves.
* In C++17, you can do `std::vector<std::variant<type1, type2, type3>> vectorName; ` so long as you aren't storing references or pointers.

## Valgrind Catching Uninitialized Value

Didn't know valgrind did this... I had an uninitialized class member variable:

```
==6056== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==6056==    at 0x10C48D: MyAgingSystem::update(double, void*) (dummymain.cpp:87)
==6056==    by 0x1138F8: decltype ((((declval<MyAgingSystem>)()).update)({parm#2}, {parm#3})) entt::process<MyAgingSystem, double>::next<MyAgingSystem>(std::integral_constant<entt::process<MyAgingSystem, double>::state, (entt::process<MyAgingSystem, double>::state)1>, double, void*) (process.hpp:94)
==6056==    by 0x110897: entt::process<MyAgingSystem, double>::tick(double, void*) (process.hpp:237)
==6056==    by 0x10E69C: bool entt::scheduler<double>::update<MyAgingSystem>(entt::scheduler<double>::process_handler&, double, void*) (scheduler.hpp:85)
==6056==    by 0x10EC34: entt::scheduler<double>::update(double, void*) (scheduler.hpp:259)
==6056==    by 0x10BBA8: main (dummymain.cpp:150)
==6056== 
```

## Console Testing

Wow, what a pain in the neck. First I started by thinking that I could grab keyboard KEY_DOWN and KEY_UP kind of events without initializing the video. This did not work (even though I initialized SDL event subsystem). Apparently, SDL only hooks up the user input to the window it creates. So if it doesn't create the window, the library will load successfully, but the functionality is severely dorked.

Since SDL wasn't working, I tried the next best thing ... curses. Well, when you call initscr(), curses simply creates a new terminal and then you can start polling with getch(). Unfortunately, I wanted to keep the old terminal, so that was a no go.

Finally, I settled on just running some stty options and configuring the stdin file descriptor to be non-blocking. This gets me a decent loop, but I have to deal with the fact that captured key presses are on the key press and I can not detect the release. I figure it shouldn't be an issue once I have Godot passing in the user input. For now I just wanted a way to quickly experiment with the new ECS system and the soon to be grid movement system.

```
// setup the console for raw input, no echo, and remove special keypresses
system("stty raw -echo onlcr -icanon");

// get current file status flags
int flags = fcntl(0, F_GETFL, 0);

// turn off blocking flag
flags |= O_NONBLOCK;

// set up non-blocking read
fcntl(0, F_SETFL, flags);

// ... do main loop ...

// clean up terminal
system("stty cooked echo");
```

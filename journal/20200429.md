## Comparing g++ with clang.

Finally got around to installing clang into my builder docker image. Just wanted to do a quick comparison between g++ and clang with the existing C++ project I am working on.

I don't have the patience for a clean checkout, so I just did a `scons -c` between builds. Also, just about all of the code is now in headers so this isn't a comparison between which does IO better and which can cache better. Its just a raw CC replacement with a single source to object and then object to ELF.

clang:

```
time docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/user/godot --rm crazychenz/godot_builder /bin/bash -c "scons -C godot platform=linux -j8 use_llvm=yes consoletest"
scons: Entering directory `/home/user/godot'
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
clang++ -o consoletest.o -c -fPIC -g3 -O0 -std=c++17 -Wfatal-errors -Iinclude consoletest.cpp
clang++ -o consoletest consoletest.o
scons: done building targets.

real    0m47.518s
user    0m0.155s
sys     0m0.386s

# A second run after clean:
real    0m45.414s
user    0m0.251s
sys     0m0.266s

# A previous run returned:
real    0m52.888s
user    0m0.361s
sys     0m0.211s
# Perhaps longer due to disk fetching?
```

g++:

```
time docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/user/godot --rm crazychenz/godot_builder /bin/bash -c "scons -C godot platform=linux -j8 consoletest"scons: Entering directory `/home/user/godot'
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
g++ -o consoletest.o -c -fPIC -g3 -O0 -std=c++17 -Wfatal-errors -Iinclude consoletest.cpp
g++ -o consoletest consoletest.o
scons: done building targets.

real    0m43.781s
user    0m0.273s
sys     0m0.246s

# A second run after clean:
real    0m42.085s
user    0m0.237s
sys     0m0.320s
```

Welp, results are in ... G++ wins. We also should remember that these numbers are inflated because of the docker and scons overhead, but they should be inflated equally for each compiler. Also worth noting is that clang may be faster at optimized code (this code used -O0) and it may have better error/warning output. So more to investigate. I am most interested in its memory leak detection capabilities so I can get rid of valgrind.

## Comparing g++ with clang.

Finally got around to installing clang into my builder docker image. Just wanted to do a quick comparison between g++ and clang with the existing C++ project I am working on.

I don't have the patience for a clean checkout, so I just did a `scons -c` between builds. Also, just about all of the code is now in headers so this isn't a comparison between which does IO better and which can cache better. Its just a raw CC replacement with a single source to object and then object to ELF.

clang:

```
time docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/user/godot --rm crazychenz/godot_builder /bin/bash -c "scons -C godot platform=linux -j8 use_llvm=yes consoletest"
scons: Entering directory `/home/user/godot'
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
clang++ -o consoletest.o -c -fPIC -g3 -O0 -std=c++17 -Wfatal-errors -Iinclude consoletest.cpp
clang++ -o consoletest consoletest.o
scons: done building targets.

real    0m47.518s
user    0m0.155s
sys     0m0.386s

# A second run after clean:
real    0m45.414s
user    0m0.251s
sys     0m0.266s

# A previous run returned:
real    0m52.888s
user    0m0.361s
sys     0m0.211s
# Perhaps longer due to disk fetching?
```

g++:

```
time docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/user/godot --rm crazychenz/godot_builder /bin/bash -c "scons -C godot platform=linux -j8 consoletest"scons: Entering directory `/home/user/godot'
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
g++ -o consoletest.o -c -fPIC -g3 -O0 -std=c++17 -Wfatal-errors -Iinclude consoletest.cpp
g++ -o consoletest consoletest.o
scons: done building targets.

real    0m43.781s
user    0m0.273s
sys     0m0.246s

# A second run after clean:
real    0m42.085s
user    0m0.237s
sys     0m0.320s
```

Welp, results are in ... G++ wins. We also should remember that these numbers are inflated because of the docker and scons overhead, but they should be inflated equally for each compiler. Also worth noting is that clang may be faster at optimized code (this code used -O0) and it may have better error/warning output. So more to investigate. I am most interested in its memory leak detection capabilities so I can get rid of valgrind.

## Virtual Destructors and Memory Leaks

When I started playing with Clang I started playing with the included Leak Memory Sanitizer. You first build the object files and ELF binary with the option `-fsanitize=address -g`. Then when you run, you have to set some environment variables. I set mine to detect leaks and report leaked objects:

```
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 LSAN_OPTIONS=report_objects=1 ./consoletest
```

This immediately indicated that I had a leak, but the results have proved useless so far:

```
=================================================================
==23851==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

Rebuilt it with g++ and pushed it through valgrind:

Much more useful. (2 points for G++/Valgrind setup so far today.) Now I have source files, object types, and code lines. With this I was able to figure out that the leak was because of a `unique_ptr<Vector2>` that I created in an `IAction` subclass that wasn't getting destructed when I called `clear()` on the vector it was stored in. Bah!

Added a quick fix incase I couldn't get to the root of the problem by adding the following line just before the `vector:clear()`:

```
std::for_each(xaction.begin(), xaction.end(), [](auto &action){ action.reset(); });
```

Went to the googles looking for why a destructor wouldn't be called when a `unique_ptr<>` was being cleared from a vector. Most of the results were folks with a similar issue and responses that had that heavy eye brown and an air of judgement that so often follows such an obscure bug. In any case, I came across this stack overflow question: [C++ unique_ptr not calling the destructor](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18345660/c-unique-ptr-not-calling-the-destructor). The OP answered their question indicating that if the destructor wasn't virtual in the class the `unique_ptr<>` was holding, it wouldn't get called. 

Well, damn. I didn't even define a destructor in the base class. Added a virtual destructor in the base class and the leak went away. Curious about this, I found this page on the subject: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-destructor/. 

The conclusion is that the base class' non-virtual constructor gets called but the base class' destructor will not get called unless it is declared virtual.

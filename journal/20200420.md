## Godot Building

Took a look at the "official" godot engine docker image Dockerfiles. I don't see how they work, and if they do I don't see any built in mechanism to build Godot without mono. Therefore I rolled my own.

In the past, I've always looked over the fact that the resulting binary from the build is greater than 800MBs. Because I plan to do more extensive testing with my custom Godot build, I needed to get to the bottom of this. Turns out that its as simple as using `strip` on the resulting binary.

In addition to strip, Godot documentation has several other recommendations:

* Add `optimize=size` to scons command line
* Add `use_lto=yes` to scons command line
* Use [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) to further compress the binary. Note: This is an independent tool that I didn't know about. You can use this for any PE or ELF file. Probably worth looking into for other embedded platforms.

At the moment, the following command is the command I am using to build Godot:

```
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/user/godot --rm crazychenz/godot_builder \
/bin/bash -c "scons -C godot -j3 platform=windows"
```

## Godot Reference Counting

Rebuilt Godot with the following patch:

```
diff --git a/core/reference.cpp b/core/reference.cpp
index dd65ccce69..68a8a3cd06 100644
--- a/core/reference.cpp
+++ b/core/reference.cpp
@@ -52,6 +52,7 @@ void Reference::_bind_methods() {
        ClassDB::bind_method(D_METHOD("init_ref"), &Reference::init_ref);
        ClassDB::bind_method(D_METHOD("reference"), &Reference::reference);
        ClassDB::bind_method(D_METHOD("unreference"), &Reference::unreference);
+       ClassDB::bind_method(D_METHOD("get_count"), &Reference::reference_get_count);
 }
 
 int Reference::reference_get_count() const {
```

This should allow me to monitor reference counts of objects within GDScript to determine the best way to manage memory going forward.
